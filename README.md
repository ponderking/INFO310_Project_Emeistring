How to run code:

1. Navigate to the directory of the code using the commandline. Now use on of the commands to host a simple server: 
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (for python 2) OR python -m http.server 8000 (for python 3) 

2. In your browser(tested on Chrome) go the URL localhost:8000 and acces the HTML file from there.

3. Start with opening the Circular_Visulization.html page, as it is the main hub for the other visualizations.
